  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is twofold: (a) to provide a tutorial introduction to some key concepts from the theory of computational complexity, highlighting their relevance to systems and control theory, and (b) to survey the relatively recent research activity lying at the interface between these fields. We begin with a brief introduction to models of computation, the concepts of undecidability, polynomial-time algorithms, NP-completeness, and the implications of intractability results. We then survey a number of problems that arise in systems and control theory, some of them classical, some of them related to current research. We discuss them from the point of view of computational complexity and also point out many open problems. In particular, we consider problems related to stability or stabilizability of linear systems with parametric uncertainty, robust control, time-varying linear systems, nonlinear and hybrid systems, and stochastic optimal control.},

In this article we develop a method which - under suitable assumptions - allows to compute the JSR and the LSR of a finite family of matrices exactly. We remark that so far no algorithm was available in the literature to compute the LSR exactly. The paper presents necessary theoretical results on extremal norms (and on extremal antinorms) of linear operators, which constitute the basic tools of our procedures, and a detailed description of the corresponding algorithms for the computation of the JSR and LSR (the last one restricted to families sharing an invariant cone). The algorithms are easily implemented and their descriptions are short.},

  abstract = {The wavelet transform is a tool that cuts up data or functions or operators into different frequency components, and then studies each component with a resolution matched to its scale. Forerunners of this technique were invented independently in pure mathematics (Calder{\'o}n's resolution of the identity in harmonic analysis---see e.g., Calder{\'o}n (1964)), physics (coherent states for the (ax + b)-group in quantum mechanics, first constructed by Aslaksen and Klauder (1968), and linked to the hydrogen atom Hamiltonian by Paul (1985)) and engineering (QMF filters by Esteban and Galland (1977), and later QMF filters with exact reconstruction property by Smith and Barnwell (1986), Vetterli (1986) in electrical engineering; wavelets were proposed for the analysis of seismic data by J. Morlet (1983)). The last five years have seen a synthesis between all these different approaches, which has been very fertile for all the fields concerned.Let us stay for a moment within the signal analysis framework. (The discussion can easily be translated to other fields.) The wavelet transform of a signal evolving in time (e.g., the amplitude of the pressure on an eardrum, for acoustical applications) depends on two variables: scale (or frequency) and time; wavelets provide a tool for time-frequency localization. The first section tells us what time-frequency localization means and why it is of interest. The remaining sections describe different types of wavelets.}

The corresponding examples and statistics of numerical results are provided. Several applications of our algorithms are presented.
