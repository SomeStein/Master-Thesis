\label{ch:finite-tree}
In this chapter I want to introduce the finite-tree algorithm and its theoretical background. 

\section{Notation and definitions}

Throughout this thesis, we consider a finite set of matrices \( \mathcal{A} = \{A_1, \dots, A_J\} \) with \( A_j \in \mathbb{R}^{s \times s} \). The computation of the JSR using tree-based methods, requires a structured representation of matrix products.

\subsection*{Encoding of Matrix Products}
The set \( \mathcal{I}^n := \{1, \dots, J\}^n \) denotes the collection of all index sequences of length \( n \). For an index sequence \( i = [i_1, \dots, i_n] \in \mathcal{I}^n \), the corresponding matrix product is given by
\[
    A_i = A_{i_n} \cdots A_{i_1}.
\]
For \( n = 0 \), we define the identity matrix \( A_i = I \).

\subsection*{Definition of an finite-tree}
\label{def:tree}
An \( (A,G) \)-tree is a structured representation of matrix products used to decompose arbitrary matrix products from $\mathcal{A}$. Lets define it given a set of generator indices \( G = \{g_1, \dots, g_I\} \subseteq J^n \):
\begin{definition}
    A Tree with the following structure: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The root node contains the identity matrix: \( t_0 = \{I\} \).
    \item Each node \( t \in T \) is either:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A leaf (i.e., it has no children),
        \item A parent of exactly \( J \) children: \( \{A_j P : P \in t\}, j = 1, \dots, J \) (positive children),
        \item A parent of arbitrarily many generators: \( \{A_g^n P : P \in t, n \in \mathbb{N}_0\} \) for some \( g \in G \) (negative children).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Is called $(\mathcal{A},\mathbf{G})\text{-tree}$
\end{definition}

\subsection*{Covered Nodes}
A node in the tree is called \textit{covered} if it is a subset of one of its ancestors in the tree. Otherwise, it is called \textit{uncovered}. 

\begin{definition}
    The set of uncovered leaves is denoted as
\[
    \mathcal{L}(T) := \{ L \in t : t \text{ is an uncovered leaf of } T \}.
\]
and called leafage of the tree $T$.
\end{definition}

\subsection*{1-Boundedness}
An \( (A,G) \)-tree $T$ is called \textit{1-bounded} with respect to a matrix norm \( \| \cdot \| \) if
\[
    \sup_{L \in \mathcal{L}(T)} \| L \| \leq 1.
\]
If a stricter bound holds, i.e., \( \sup_{L \in \mathcal{L}(T)} \| L \| < 1 \), then the tree is called \emph{strictly 1-bounded}.

\section{Structure of the finite-tree algorithm}
We start with the root node, the identity $t_0 = {I}$. Now we build up an $(\mathcal{A},\mathbf{G})\text{-tree}$.
For that we calculate the norms of the children of current leaf-nodes and if they are bigger than 1 we add them to the tree. 
The chosen norm in this case is arbitrary but changes the runtime dramatically. 
If the algorithm terminates a 1-bounded tree was found and by that we have proven that there exists a decomposition for every product of matrices from $\mathcal{A}$.

\begin{theorem}
    If the finite-tree algorithm~\ref{alg:tree} terminates the $\JSR(\mathcal{A})$ was found. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The leafage of the generated tree is 1-bounded. Now we take an arbitrary product $P \in \mathcal{A}^n$.
    If the profduct is outside the current tree i.e. after applying lexicographic ordering on the encodings of the nodes the encoding of the product is bigger then every other encoding in the tree. 
    That means the structure of $(A,G)$-trees allows us to find one leaf-node that is a valid prefix of the product. Now we have $P = P'L$ with $\lVert L \rVert \le 1$. Since every leaf-node is guaranteed to have at least length 1 (first branches must be $\mathcal{A}$) the length of $P'$ is strictly smaller then the length of $P$. We can repeat that process until $P'^{(k)}$ is within the tree.
    If the product is within the tree, we can generate a polynomial $p(k)$ that is monotone and an upper bound on the norms of products within the tree, where $k$ is the length of the product. 
    For that we have to analyse the Jordan-Normalform of the products. Since the spectral radius of every matrix in $\mathcal{A}$ and of every generator is less than 1, we now the growth of potencies of the Jordan-blocks is bounded by a polynomial in the order of the size of the Jordan-block. Just taking a maximum over all factors of all such polynomials we generate a polynomial that bounds every product within the tree according to the length of the product.  
    So every product $P \in \mathcal{A}^n$ is of the form $P = S \cdot P_k \cdot ... \cdot P_1$ where $\lVert P_i \rVert \le 1$ and $\lVert S \rVert \le p(k)$. We imply: 
    $$JSR(\mathcal{A}) = \lim_k \max_{P \in \mathcal{A}^k} \lVert P \rVert ^{\frac{1}{k}} \leq \lim_k p(k) ^{\frac{1}{k}}  = 1$$
    The detailed proof can be read in \citep{mollerTreebasedApproachJoint2014}. 
\end{proof}

\section{Efficiency results}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:same_solution}
    If the invariant-polytope algorithm terminates so does the finite-tree algorithm.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The proof can be seen in \citep{mollerTreebasedApproachJoint2014}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    The solution space of the finite-tree algorithm is strictly bigger then the one from the invariant-polytope algorithm. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    From theorem~\ref{thm:same_solution} we know that the finite-tree algorithm always terminates if the invariant-polytope algorithm does.
    But there exist cases where the finite-tree algorithm terminates but the ivariant-polytope algorithm does not. 
\end{proof}

\section{Ussage of generators}
In~\citep{mollerTreebasedApproachJoint2014}, the authors show that the use of generators is essential for ensuring termination in cases where the invariant-polytope algorithm fails to terminate.
