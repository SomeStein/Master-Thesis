\begin{definition}{$(\mathcal{A},\mathbf{G})\text{-tree}$}
A Tree with the following structure: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The root consists of the identity matrix $I$
    \item The root has $\{A: A \in \mathcal{A}\}$ as children
    \item every other node is either a leaf, has exactly $\{A: A \in \mathcal{A}\}$ or any amount of generators $A_g \in \mathbf{G}$ as children
\end{enumerate}
Is called $(\mathcal{A},\mathbf{G})\text{-tree}$
